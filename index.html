    <h1>Expectations</h1>
    <p>Tell me how you feel about this class, what are you looking forward to, what are you afraid of?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some of us already took this course last year. This doesn't mean we are not looking forward to do it again. Last year was very interesting but we think some revision will do us good because it was quite a lot of new stuff to take in! That's why I am happy to take it again, I hope I will remember more (especially the more advanced stuff).</p>
    <p>The rest, who didn't take this class, hope to learn more about javascript.</p>
    <p>We hope to learn a lot, despite that we think that the course will be 'pittig'.</p>
